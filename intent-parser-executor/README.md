intent-parser-executor
Welcome to Your Project Title Here, an innovative intent-driven self-modifying code system. This tool allows your program to autonomously read, interpret, and apply change instructions â€” or intents â€” to its own source code, enabling dynamic evolution and customization.

Features
Read and process natural-language-style intents from a text file.

Support for commands like insert, delete, replace, append, and modify.

Backup creation before each modification for safety.

Automatic ordering of intent execution to avoid conflicts.

Easy customization for your own project filenames and intents.

Getting Started
Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

Basic knowledge of Python scripting

Installation
Clone or download this repository.

Make sure nova_intents.txt (or your intent file) is present in the project folder.

Adjust filenames and paths inside the intent file and source code comments to fit your project.

Usage
Write your intents in the project_title_intents.txt file. Examples of intents:

insert your_project_file.py at line 6 with print("ðŸ”¥ Inserted line at 6!")
delete your_project_file.py from line 3 to 4
replace your_project_file.py lines 10-11 with ["print('ðŸ”¥ line 10 replaced')", "print('ðŸ”¥ line 11 replaced')"]
append your_project_file.py with print("ðŸ“Œ Appended line")
Run the intent manager script:

python your_intent_manager.py
Watch your code update automatically based on your intents!

How It Works
The manager reads the intent file line-by-line, ignoring blanks or comments.

Intents are parsed into commands and target lines.

Commands are grouped and executed in a safe order to prevent line conflicts:

Top-down commands (modify, replace, append) first.

Bottom-up commands (insert, delete) second.

A backup copy of the modified file is created before any changes.

Customization
Search for the placeholder your_project_title_here inside the scripts and replace it with your actual project filename or title.

Modify the intent parsing logic if you need support for additional commands.

Adjust backup folder paths or naming conventions as needed.
